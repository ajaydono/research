Contribution Guide for Web3Privacy now Research branch.

Welcome! Web3Privacy now facilitates an open-research proccess on decentralized privacy aiming to empower developers, researchers, activists, enterpreneurs and general public with data-driven analytics on the state of privacy in the web3 realm & it’s intersection with so-called “web2” privacy.

_Criterias of contribution_

1. _Chain agnostic_ - don't lobby any specific chain. This helps to create well-balance snapshot on the state of the privacy market.
2. _Pro-stack approach_ - privacy doesn't end with the "protocol" or "coin" - it's a stack from messeging protocols to storage. Recognising privacy stack complexity helps better to articulate balance between web3 + web2 privacy (eg.: "Railgun for EVM transactional privacy", but "Signal for messeging"), and missing links on the way to default decentralised privacy across all possible stack categories.
