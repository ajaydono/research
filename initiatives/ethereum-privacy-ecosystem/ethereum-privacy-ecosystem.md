# Context
Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem is highly dissconnected. R&D primitives & tooling are there, developers build hackathon demos, but there are almost no end-user privacy apps. Mapping ecosystem will help to highlight existing actors, create connections and foster ecosystem towards delivering practical daily privacy within Ethereum.

# Goals
Fill existing knowledge gap: Create an actionable map structuring global players delivering privacy in Ethereum from L2s like Aztec to local Privacy LATAM communities. 

Significantly increase privacy impact-metrics: more people building privacy-tooling, apps getting mentors, access to finances and markets.

# Approach
Focus on a builder journey from "I never build privacy dapp in my life" to reach privacy-market-fit. Curating available resources, links, people and organizations that can help everyone exploring Ethereum privacy.
Research framework 
aggregate all privacy projects, initiatives & R&D that has been delivered from Privacy & Scaling Explorations to hackathons like ETHRome.
structure them in categories and tags (from private voting to privacy-focused events and communities)
provide hygine check on link availability (alive post-hackathon like ETHBerlin repos or sunset projects like Nocturne)
facilitated unified open-knowledge DB available to all from researchers to product managers

# Milestones

**Preliminary research (1 month)**
source existing projects, organizations, tools, communities, individuals, events within a privacy landscape
collect all links in 1 place

**Ecosystem mapping (2 months)**
- 1on1 interviews with key actors + local representation (examples: Aztec, Railgun, 0xbow, Fluidkey, Rotki, Department Of Decentralization, Mask Network (China), Privacy LATAM, 0xParc, Fileverse)
total # of interviews: 30
- highlight Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem "stack" (from R&D tech to communities) that will be turned into a map
- collect insights (ammount of privacy demos per hackathon, Railgun operational fees, MACI implementations, ammount of people using privacy tooling etc)

**Public delivery (1.5 months)**

- Github-friendly PDF report
- Github-friendly repo-as-a-DB
- Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem infographic (jpg)
- Public presentation at [Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress](http://congress.web3privacy.info), 16 Nov, Buenos Aires

# Deliverables

- Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem research map (PDF report: 30 1on1 interviews; min 100 pages)
- Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem micro-web 

**Post-reserach**
- Open-data maintainance: we comit to maintain Ethereum Privacy Knowledge base by adding new projects, events, research into general DB.
- Advocacy: report will be actively share with every key privacy players within ecosystem, integrated into hackathons, meetups, Cypherpunk Congresses.
