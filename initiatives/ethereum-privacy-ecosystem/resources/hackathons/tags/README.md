# Privacy Project Tags

This directory defines the **standard tags** used across privacy projects submitted to Ethereum hackathons. Tags help us organize and analyze trends in the ecosystem by function, technology, and use case.

When contributing a privacy project, include **1â€“4 tags** from the list below in the `tags` column of `privacy-projects.md`.

**Tagging Guidelines:**

- Use lowercase, comma-separated tags.
- Be descriptive but concise.
- Avoid overly niche tags unless the category is emerging or growing.
