# Test Research

This is a test file with broken YAML frontmatter that should be automatically fixed.

## Some findings

- Finding 1
- Finding 2

The `authors` field has unquoted GitHub usernames which will cause YAML parsing errors.
The `title` and `timeline` fields have special characters that need quoting.
The `tags` field is missing completely.
