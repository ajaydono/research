IMPORTANT: You must delete everything between these comment blocks before 
creating your pull request or committing your research document.

## 3-Phase Research Process:

### PHASE 1: DEFINITION (Research Proposal)
1. Copy the template folder: `cp -r templates/research-initiative initiatives/your-research-name`
2. Copy this template: `cp templates/research-initiative.md initiatives/your-research-name/your-research-name.md`
3. Delete the template README: `rm initiatives/your-research-name/README.md`
4. Complete sections from "Overview" through "Timeline & Milestones" 
5. Create your research proposal - commit this to establish your initiative.

Required sections for Phase 1:
‚úÖ Overview (description, questions, impact)
‚úÖ Objectives (primary & secondary goals)  
‚úÖ Methodology (approach, data sources, success criteria)
‚úÖ Scope & Boundaries (what's in/out)
‚úÖ Resources & Assets (what you need)
‚úÖ Timeline & Milestones (phases and deadlines)

### PHASE 2: EXECUTION (Active Research & Review)
Start researching and document your findings in the "Research Findings" section.
Update your document as you discover things - it's a living organic document.

### PHASE 3: CONCLUSION (Retrospective & Completion)Retrospective & Completion)
Complete remaining sections, synthesize findings, write conclusions.
Iterate until research status moves to "final".
Please, note that your research might move multiple times between active <> review.

## Collaboration:
- Use GitHub issues for tracking tasks and reflect them on the [board](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/11)
- Create pull requests for updates
- Follow the guides and templates
- Tag relevant community members for feedback
- Update status and timeline regularly
- Cross-reference related initiatives

## Quality Standards:
- Support all claims with evidence
- Cite sources properly (including informal ones like Discord / X)
- Make data verifiable and reproducible where possible
- Request peer review for major transitions (draft ‚Üí active ‚Üí review)
