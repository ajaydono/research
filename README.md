Web3Privacy Now conducts research to map, analyze, and advance the Web3 privacy ecosystem. We focus on:

- **Ecosystem Analysis**: Mapping privacy projects, tools, and protocols across Web3
- **Market Research**: Understanding adoption, funding, and growth trends in privacy tech
- **Technical Analysis**: Evaluating privacy tools, comparing approaches, and identifying gaps
- **Policy Research**: Analyzing regulatory landscapes and compliance frameworks
- **Use Case Studies**: Exploring practical applications of privacy technologies

Our research findings serve our community to advance privacy in Web3.

## Initiatives

Browse active research in the `initiatives/` folder:

- **[Ethereum Privacy Ecosystem](initiatives/ethereum-privacy-ecosystem/)**: Comprehensive analysis of privacy solutions on Ethereum
- **[Privacy Landscape Map](initiatives/privacy-landscape-map/)**: Visual mapping of 700+ privacy projects across Web3

## Process

You only need tocCopy the complete research template and rename / clean up your foldee:
```bash
cp -r templates/research-initiative initiatives/your-research-name
rm initiatives/your-research-name/README.md
mv initiatives/your-research-name/research-initiative.md initiatives/your-research-name/your-research-name.md
```

Your research initiative must follow the three phases:
1. Definition (Research Proposal):
   - Fill out the YAML metadata (title, status: draft, authors, category)
   - Complete Overview through Timeline sections to establish your research proposal
   - Create a GitHub issue using our research issue template to announce your initiative
   - Commit your research proposal

2. Execution (Active Research):
   - Begin researching and document findings in the Research Findings section
   - Update your document as you discover things - it's a _living, organic_ document
   - Note: your research may move between active and review multiple times

3. Conclusion (Retrospective & Completion):
   - Complete retrospective analysis of what you learned and discovered
   - Identify future research opportunities that build on your work
   - Conclusion all sections before moving to "final" status

The lifecycle is `Draft → Active → Review → Final`.
